          Apart from the ideal geographical position and established trade
          routes throughout the island, Cyprus also has to offer one of the most

          have been designed and implemented to ensure successful business growth.
          Various global companies have chosen Cyprus for the maximization and optimum

        <LegalAccordion title="Income from Dividends is Tax-Free">
          <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
            <p>
              In most cases, income from dividends is exempt from tax. This
              makes Cyprus holding companies a very attractive proposition for
              international groups or individuals investing abroad, aiming at
              dividend income streams. This is also very favorable as a
              repatriation vehicle where the investor’s jurisdiction does not
              have a favorable treaty with the country in which they wish to
              invest. Because capital gains on investments are not taxable,
              Cyprus is the perfect location for holding companies with
              subsidiaries that have potential for high capital appreciation
              that may be spun off or sold in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
              The only exceptions that are eligible for Special Contribution for
              Defense Tax to be applied on dividends received from non-Cypriot
              companies at the rate of 17% will be in the following cases:
            </p>
            <ul class="pl-16">
              <li class="list-disc">
                The income of the subsidiary is subject to an effective tax
                burden of 5% or lower; and
              </li>
              <li class="list-disc">
                The subsidiary engages, directly or indirectly, more than 50% in
                activities leading to investment income (e.g. holding of bank
                deposits to earn interest).

        <LegalAccordion title="Tax-Free Profits from the Sales of Shares">
          <div class="flex flex-col gap-6">
            <p>
              In Cyprus, profits from the sales of securities (defined as
              “shares, bonds, debentures, founders’ shares and other securities
              of companies or other legal person, incorporated under a law In
              Cyprus or abroad, including options thereon”) are generally exempt
              from tax, even if this is the only trading activity of the
              company.
            </p>
            <p>
              There is one exception of 20% capital gain tax, for the profit
              earned from the sales of shares in certain non-listed companies,
              owning real estate in Cyprus.
