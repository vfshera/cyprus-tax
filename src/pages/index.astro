            a country for tax evasion purposes. As Cyprus is not an Offshore
            Zone, it is therefore not included in any of the ‘blacklists’. On
            the contrary, since Cyprus is an EU member since 2004, Cypriot
            companies are European companies and are enjoying all the rights and
            benefits of the EU, simply under considerably lower level of
            taxation of Cyprus.
